# PhysioworksApp
### Created by Alanna Curran © Curran Studio 2016

##Outline
This is an iOS app for Physioworks Moycullen, it is a 4-5 page App navigated by a bar at the base.

What was requested was a page about the clinic, treatments, a booking online page, a location page and a client form page in that order.

### About the clinic
-	This will have info on the clinic and Physio, including qualifications and such.
-	There will also be a link to the clinics Facebook page, LinkedIn and, website.

### About the treatments
-	This page will outline the treatments that are used by the Physio including various injuries and conditions that she treats.

### Booking online page
-	Working with Rushcliff in the UK, they are the provider of the practices software, to incorporate their API to create a booking online page.
-	Rushcliff currently has no Apple apps so are eager to see the application completed.

### Location page
-	This page will have a map, tomtom link, google map link and directions to the clinic.
-	There will also be contact info.

### Client form page
-	This will be a form for new patients to fill out some basic info before their appointment.
-	It will then be emailed to Sonya to put on file.
-	This will save time during initial consultations.

##Scope of Work done
A few things changed for this project but not for the app, which will continue to be developed over time.
The tomtom and google maps links require a bit more knowledge and experience in Swift coding which I do not have, but I will be attending a course over the summer to rectify this. 

The map in the app currently provides the best route from the user’s location.
The same is pretty much true for the API. But clients can use the client form to request an appointment for the time being.
Other than that all objectives were met in the app.
